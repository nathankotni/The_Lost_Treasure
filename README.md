## Game Overview ##


**Game Description:**

This game is a lane based arcade game similar to the popular mobile games Subway Surfer or Temple Run but coded in Java with JavaFX and adapted to have keyboard or mouse controls, a swashbuckling pirate theme, and a definitive victory after 5 levels. There are be 3-5 lanes (varying between levels) in the ocean which a boat would maneuver between to avoid obstacles that are present in certain ocean lanes. The boat has the illusion of constantly moving forward from the eyes of the player while actually staying in place vertically due to the objects of the ocean moving backwards. Depending on what type of obstacle is hit, the result is different. If a large obstacle is hit, the game ends. If a medium obstacle is hit, the boat can only sustain one more hit from any obstacle. If a small obstacle is hit, the boat can sustain two more small obstacle hits or one more medium obstacle hit. Obstacles will have different appearances and sizes based on whether they are large, medium, or small, and even among these sub-categories there are be a variety of images to represent them. With each level, the speed that the boat moves forward gets faster and this increases the frequency of obstacles being spawned, essentially making the obstacles come down faster. Levels end after a certain amount of time has elapsed. The first level contains 3 lanes, and this steadily increases to 5 lines among the total of 5 levels that the game contains and larger objects tend to spawn more often in the later levels. There are also power ups in the game to slow down time and make the obstacles come down slower for a limited amount of time. Over all of the levels, if the "secret keys" are collected, of which there will be one in each level, then the lost treasure can be found again.


**Game Controls:**

The boat can be controlled by the left and right arrow keys and switch lanes using these controls, and the slow down time power-ups are activated automatically when collected. There is a button in the corner of the game that is labeled with the symbol "||" which can be clicked to pause the game. In the title screen there will be a button that says "Play" which will be used to start playing the game, and there will also be a settings button, where you can toggle various settings. One of the settings is to switch the boat controls from keyboard controls to mouse controlled. The way a mouse controlled boat works: simply click on a lane that is on on either side of the lane the boat is currently in, and the boat will move over to the nearest lane on that. You cannot have mouse controls and keyboard controls activated simultaneously.


**Game Elements:**

- The boat which you control

- Randomly spawning obstacles: comes in sizes large, medium, and small, and there are a variety of images to represent each of these sizes

- The representation of the ocean underneath the boat

- Randomly spawning waves that move backwards on the screen very fast to appear like the boat is moving forward

- Time Slow Down power-ups which spawn randomly (higher rate of spawn in higher levels)

- Secret Keys that spawn once per level and are used to achieve the true ending


**How to Win:**

Navigate through all of the obstacles as the levels get progressively harder until you finish level 5 (the last level), upon which
you will reach a Game Won screen. If you collected all of the "secret keys" then you can achieve a true ending Game Won screen.
